**WARNING: Unmaintained code ahead**

As an alternative please try out Google's own [FPL Utils - NDK perf](https://google.github.io/fplutil/android_ndk_perf.html),
which provides a non-intrusive way to profile your applications using Linux perf. However be warned that this too is only supported on [2 somewhat-obsolete devices](https://github.com/google/fplutil/blob/master/bin/android_ndk_perf.py#L58).

The general churn in Android means that this library has suffered some severe bit-rot over the last couple of years. If you can help then pull requests are appreciated, but I no longer have the time or motivation to work on the project.

Profile Android NDK code. Further instructions [on the docs/Usage.md page][Usage].

There are examples on the [docs/Example.md][Example] page and the design decisions are discussed on the [docs/HowItWorks.md][HowItWorks] page.
